# Stock Price Prediction Model

This project is a deep learning/machine learning model that predicts the stock prices of [Target Stock Market or Company, e.g., KOSPI, Samsung Electronics] using [Model Name, e.g., LSTM, ARIMA].

## 📜 Overview

The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices by training on historical stock data. Please describe the specific objective here, such as: [e.g., to predict the closing price for a specific period. / to predict the upward or downward trend of the stock price.]

## ✨ Features

  * **Data Collection**: Collects stock price data from [Data Source, e.g., Yahoo Finance, Naver Finance].
  * **Data Preprocessing**: Processes data into a suitable format for stock price prediction, including moving averages and normalization.
  * **Model Training**: Trains the stock price prediction model using [Deep Learning/Machine Learning Library, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn].
  * **Result Visualization**: Visualizes and compares actual vs. predicted stock prices using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly.
  * **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using various metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and MAE.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

  * **Language**: `Python 3.x`
  * **Libraries**:
      * `Pandas`: For data analysis and manipulation.
      * `NumPy`: For numerical operations.
      * `TensorFlow` / `PyTorch` / `Scikit-learn`: For machine learning and deep learning models.
      * `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn` / `Plotly`: For data visualization.
      * `Jupyter Notebook`: As the project development environment.

  * **Period**: [Data Period, e.g., 2010-01-01 to 2023-12-31]
  * **Features Used**: `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, etc.

## 📈 Model & Performance

[Provide a brief description of the model used, e.g., An LSTM model was used, designed to predict the next day's closing price based on the past N days of data.]

**Model Performance:**

  * **RMSE**: [Evaluation Result Value]
  * **MAE**: [Evaluation Result Value]


## 🚀 Future Work
